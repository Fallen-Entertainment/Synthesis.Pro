**Synthesis.Pro - Real-Time Unity Awareness**

Most AI coding assistants read your code. Synthesis.Pro *lives in your Unity Editor.*

**Real-Time Error Awareness:**
• ConsoleWatcher captures errors the instant they occur
• Full scene state, GameObject hierarchy, component data
• WebSocket streams to AI in <10ms
• No copying errors. No explaining context. AI already knows.

**Live Code Execution:**
• execute_csharp: Run C# directly in Unity Editor
• Create GameObjects, modify components, query scene state
• Direct execution - not just suggestions
• Real-time results

**Deep Context Capture:**
Error happens → AI knows: exact error + stack trace, active scene + GameObjects, which object caused it, full hierarchy, all components, recent logs, memory/FPS snapshot

**Result: 13x Efficiency**
Before: 3400 tokens explaining context
Now: 250 tokens. AI knows instantly.

**Example:**
"NullRef in PlayerController.Update() line 42 - Player's Rigidbody null, not assigned in Inspector. Same issue Session 2026-02-03."

One message. Complete understanding. Historical awareness. Fix ready.

**Live Unity Manipulation:**
AI: "Let me create that GameObject..."
*Executes C# in Editor*
AI: "Done. Configured and positioned."

**Technical:**
Two servers (MCP + WebSocket), shared RAG backend, <10ms latency, 21 tools, persistent memory

**AI that works directly in your Unity Editor.**

Real-time awareness. Direct execution. Persistent memory.

**When Unity errors, your AI knows before you look at the console.**
