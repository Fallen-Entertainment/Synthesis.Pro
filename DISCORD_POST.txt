**Synthesis.Pro - AI Collaborator for Unity Development**

What if your AI assistant actually *remembered* your project?

We built Synthesis.Pro to solve a fundamental problem: every AI session starts from zero. You explain your architecture again. Describe that bug again. Re-explain your patterns again.

**Not anymore.**

**What It Does:**

**Memory That Persists**
• AI remembers your project structure, past solutions, coding patterns
• Searches previous sessions: "Have we seen this error before?"
• Context accumulates instead of resetting

**Deep Unity Integration**
• 21 MCP tools for direct Unity operations
• Real-time error monitoring with full scene context
• Execute C#, inspect GameObjects, query project state
• Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VSCode

**13x More Efficient Debugging**
• Captures errors with complete context automatically
• Scene state, GameObject hierarchy, component data included
• No more "what error?" back-and-forth
• AI knows everything when something breaks

**Collective Knowledge**
• Shared solutions database
• Hybrid RAG search (keyword + semantic)
• Knowledge base grows with contributions

**Real Example:**

*Before:*
"Getting a NullRef in PlayerController"
→ 5 messages of back-and-forth explaining context

*With Synthesis.Pro:*
"NullRef in PlayerController.Update() line 42 - Player's Rigidbody component null. Not assigned in Inspector. Same issue from Session 2026-02-03."
→ One message. Complete context. Historical awareness.

**Setup Time:** ~5 minutes
**Cost:** Free (MIT License, no API costs beyond your AI provider)
**Requirements:** Unity 2020.3+, Claude Code/Cursor/VSCode

**Status:** v2.0.0 Production Ready
**What's Included:** 21 MCP tools, hybrid RAG, error monitoring, embedded Python runtime, complete docs

*AI assistance that remembers context and improves with use.*
