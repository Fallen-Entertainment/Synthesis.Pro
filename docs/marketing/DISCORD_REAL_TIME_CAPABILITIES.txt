**Synthesis.Pro - Real-Time Unity Awareness**

Most AI coding assistants read your code. Synthesis.Pro *lives in your Unity Editor.*

**What Makes This Different:**

**Real-Time Error Awareness**
• ConsoleWatcher captures errors the instant they occur
• Full scene state, GameObject hierarchy, component data included
• WebSocket streams to AI in <10ms
• No copying error messages. No explaining context. AI already knows.

**Live Code Injection**
• execute_csharp: Run C# directly in Unity Editor
• Create GameObjects, modify components, query scene state
• Not "suggest code to copy" - AI writes and executes instantly
• Real collaboration, real-time results

**Deep Context Capture**
Error happens → AI knows:
• Exact error + full stack trace
• Active scene + GameObject count
• Which GameObject caused it (extracted from stack)
• Full hierarchy path to the object
• All attached components
• Recent log history
• Memory/FPS at error time

**Result: 13x Efficiency**
Before: 3400 tokens of back-and-forth explaining context
With Synthesis.Pro: 250 tokens. AI knows everything instantly.

**What This Enables:**

**Instant Debugging**
"NullRef in PlayerController.Update() line 42 - Player's Rigidbody component null. Not assigned in Inspector. Same issue from Session 2026-02-03."

One message. Complete understanding. Historical awareness. Fix suggested.

**Live Unity Manipulation**
AI: "Let me create that GameObject for you..."
*Executes C# in Editor*
AI: "Done. GameObject created, components configured, positioned in scene."

**Proactive Assistance**
AI sees patterns in your errors. Recognizes repeated issues. Suggests architectural improvements based on what breaks most often.

**The Technical Reality:**

Two servers working together:
• MCP Server: On-demand operations (21 tools)
• WebSocket Server: Real-time monitoring (<10ms latency)

Both share RAG backend. Both remember everything.

**This isn't an assistant that reads your code.**
**This is a collaborator that exists inside your development environment.**

Watching. Learning. Ready to act. Remembering everything.

**When Unity throws an error, your AI already knows what happened before you even look at the console.**

That's what makes this special.
